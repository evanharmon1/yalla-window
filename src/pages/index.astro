      A significant amount of time between cleaning paired with the added heat of one or a number of midwest summer’s will
      often leave a layer of ‘haze buildup’ on your windows. Without the proper tools, this layer of accumulation is nearly
      impossible to get off. We’ll carefully and safely take care of that extra haze to ensure your windows are as see through
      as the day they were installed.

      Throughout the process of building a new home, many different materials often find their way to the surface of your
      brand new windows. From paint chippings, to hardened mud or clay, to caulking that has dripped onto your windows, all
      of these get in the way and without the proper experience and tools can be quite difficult to get off. We’ll put that
      final touch on your home, removing all of these substances, and leaving you with a perfectly clean window and that
      oh so coveted curb appeal that you’re after!
